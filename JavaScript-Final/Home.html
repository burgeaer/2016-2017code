        <h2>Welcome to Timeless Games.</h2>
            <p>My name is Aeryn Burgess and Ive been a lover of GameCube Games ever since the age of five. Now that I have gotten older and no longer having a GameCube in my home. Its finally time I gave them to people who really need that last piece to there collection.</p>

        <p>Most of the titles I have are Mario themed, but I do have a few hidden gems I'm sure you will enjoy</p>

        <p>Happy Gaming Everyone. </p>
        <p>If there are any errors on this site, I will do my best to find the problem asap. Here is a video of my debugging process</p>
