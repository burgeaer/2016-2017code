		<p class="shift2">Hiroshi Yamauchi - The Ceo at Nintendo for many years until he died in 2014, He started working with them in 1947 after his grandfather passed on. He was critized for being too young and not qualified to work in this field. He proved them wrong though, In fact he ran the comapny like no else did. He introduced the making of toys and video games and releasing new technolgies into the world. When he was young he never thought he would become a Ceo of a comapny this big. He wanted to be an engineer, but the World War II took that away from him. He still ended up doing something in that field by working for Nintendo. His work inspired what is now possible today  </p>
