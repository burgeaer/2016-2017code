			<p>Super Smash Brothers: 64</p>
			
			<li>1P mode - is the only single-player campaign mode available to play in Super Smash Bros. In the mode, players progress through a series of 11 matches (interrupted by a bonus stage after every three matches), culminating in a final battle with the game's boss, Master Hand. The mode has a static nature in which the player faces the same characters on the same stages in a fixed order during each playthrough. There are fourteen stages including bonus stages in this mode and players may choose their character, the difficulty, and number of lives before the playthrough.</li>
			
			<li>Vs. mode -  The characters can participate in a variety of battles, including Free-for-alls and team battles. The players can also set the rules for the battle including the amount of time, the amount of stock, the items that can be used, handicaps, and the stage that the battle will take place on. The players can also choose settings for the computer players including computer players' levels. Some of these features, however, have to be unlocked in order for them to be used.</li>
			
			<li>Target Smash - The game records the shortest time taken to smash all ten targets. If a character has never smashed all the targets, the game will also record how many targets were smashed in that time. There is also a total time that is kept that includes the cumulative time taken to clear every character's stage, which appears only after all characters have cleared their stage.</li>

			<li>Vs. mode -  The characters can participate in a variety of battles, including Free-for-alls and team battles.

			<li>Classic Mode- where you choose a character and a difficulty where you have a fixed route of possible characters to defeat in order to win.</li>
			
			<li>The Subspace Emissary- is a side-scrolling adventure in the style of a platformer, inspired by the Mario and Kirby games. However, it retains all basic mechanics of the Super Smash Bros. series, such as a damage meter, stocks, and Smash-style attacks. It can also be classified as a beat 'em up; often stages will pause at specific points and force the player to defeat a set of enemies, which prevents one from simply running through everything.The mode features a world map where stages are selected; once a stage is selected, the difficulty can be chosen, and the character(s) will enter the stage. The selectable characters will change depending on the plot. Stages that have been completed already can be played again with the exception of some stages where the player must wait until the Subspace Emissary is beaten like Midair Stadium.</li>

			<li>Multi-Man Melee: Destroy as many multi-men as you can with a given time limit.</li>
			
			<li>Boss Battles - Battle every boss from the Subspace Emissary, and choose the difficulty. </li>
